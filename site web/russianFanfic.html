			<h1>A perfect world carried of hand.</h1><br /><br />
			<h2>Posted March 15th<br />
			by <h3>Matt Papandreou</h3></h2>
			
			<p>
			One day, a man dreamed about a perfect world, but our current world is very far from it. In a world where rich people want and do not see any more the poor men, this is so strong that the rich look by all the means to avoid the poverty, by moving that by helicopter. There is no assistance of the State to help people in distress,  more and more Malthusian State justifies itself by calling that if we help it, the poor will not want to escape, then the situation is more and more a critical, there is a total break between both societies. In this evident anarchy, a man, John Phillips has only a wish, it is of balanced this society, endowed with an intelligence press but not being a member of the high society, he had to find a work of courier for the chief, in the only purpose to move closer to it to the person who detains all the technologies of the financial market, financial markets govern all this proto-society of an even wilder capitalist.
One day, John Phillips went to the building of Chief to deliver a parcel to the chief, he discovered that the means the easiest to hijack the financial system is to act on its algorithms of trading. Quickly, he found the person who has access there and he corrupts his mind, he succeeds in making her install software of capture and change of coded data. After some modifications algorithmic of the financial market, the chief lost millions of dollars, this would have been able to pass unnoticed between the billions of dollars which is exchanged at very high speed and in an autonomous way without the attention informed about Ariel Konstantine, the secretary of the Chief, she redrew all that John Phillips was able to make but considers that it cannot be the work of a single man because it is too complex. Then John who does not know that he is looked for continues change algorithmic, but Ariel having one sorts of faculty of clear-sightedness manages to feel the moment or John is going to attack, she is with a group of hacker to find quickly John, but this one is always undetectable.
However, John sees Ariel every day during his work without same knowing that she is for her   research. One day, he had a conversation with Ariel and he fell in love immediately, which does not prevent him to continue its actions, what is more and more complicated because she gets closer. She so got closer that she  openly, she  met in a dilemma, gave up itself the person that she likes or making nothing, she  chooses John and from now on, she persuades Chief that she always is chasing the person which hijacks the algorithms.
