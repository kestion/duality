			« Her hair is thick and blond, waking up next to it makes you feel like you'd been sleeping next to an angel. She ain't really pretty but God does she knows how to make a man happy. She's just like tango, that girl : talking to her is like tackling a ridle and I ain't even talking about trying to get something from her ! She's got that big troudy mouth and she sure knows how to use it. Every conversation ends in a fight, that she wins of course. But she's a sweet girl, one of my favourites. Had a hard time before, got beaten by her husband, lost a child in labour, came here broke and empty inside. But now she's wiped her tears, even though I sometimes hear her, all alone up there, crying her heart out. But who doesn't do that sometimes ? She grew up in a farm, close to the Ivory Coast. She knows all there is to know about sailing, fishing, hunting, crops and the likes. And she'll just love to tell you about her early days as a country girl, punctuating every story with that deep southern laugh of her. That's a girl that got her head on her shoulders though, never a bad word and don't think about talking ill about religion in front of her ! But she ain't a nun either : you should watch her drinking gin ! The funny thing is she doesn't even like gin that much , she says that « after tasting good ole moonshine this is just like those cans of juice you'd get in school after recess ». A funny girl, and intelligent with that. You wouldn't know if I didn't tell you, cause of that rude way of talking she has, but she sure got brains. She can read and write, do maths too, she can play the piano and sing. You can talk with her 'bout almost anything and she got something to answer. She reads a lot that's why. And that ain't the only things she's good at : a jewel that girl I'm telling you ! »

			That's how Ishram sold his girls. After a speech like that one, who was I for choosing any other girl then Gilda. I gave him the ten bucks I owed him and I went up to Gilda's appartement. And she most definitly was something else. She opened the door naked, a bottle of gin in her left hand, a half lit up cigarette in the other, a huge smile on her face and a snearing laugh that sounded something like « catch me if you can ». She smelled like poppies and I liked poppies. My mother used to make necklaces out of them and my sisters could wear them, on their foreahead, around their necks or as bracelets. I wasn't allowed to, because I was a boy and flowers aren't manly, but I'd wear them anyways. Gilda, if you could overcome the smell of gin, also smelled like apples and salt and dirt. She was one of these girls, the ones that don't belong in a city. She let my cry while clutching her all night though. Ishram always know what I need.
