			John was clearly hearing the spit spat of the rain falling on the window-pane. It was a dark summer's night and it felt like nothing would be enough to satifsy John's soul tonight. His head was pounding with hate and disgust. The world was darker then ever before, a veil of terror had felt before his eyes : how could human beings do such things to fellow human beings without being tormented about it ! How could the gap between comrades and comrades become so deep without any valid reason ! How could people let other people die in pain without a glint of culpability. John had worked all day, a mourn, mourn job. No actions were done today, no time, no opportunity. Everytime the balance was left untouch this happened. John would come back to his appartement in the suburbs and get trapped in this thick coat of darkness and angst. He knew well enough how stupid it was, how unecessary and unusefull but he couldn 't help it. Not a thing could pull him out of his demonic landscape. Not wine. Not scotch. Not cancers. Not women. Nothing but white rage turned against himself. He would crouch in a corner and let his brain fuse, and yell silently. It would take all his energy (good and bad) away. Everytime he'd just fall asleep there, empty again, ready for the next day, the next action. As soon as the morning would be back, he would start making plans again, giving and taking, making it right, all had to be right. 
			<br /><br />
				He wasn't a victim though, a victim of himself. He was a self made man, he had chosen his path ; and that was to even things up. He had sworn and would never allow himself to walk away from his destinity. He didn 't see himself as God though. Was there a God ? John didn't believe in God. God had abandoned us. How could anyone believe in such a thing whilst living in the new Babylone. A Babylone that hasn't been destroyed yet, one that will never be . Some people did see him as God, his actions were described by some like miracles ; others belivied it was Mother Nature taking revenge ; others that it was Satan playing with the world that God had abandoned long ago. John knew however. Satan had left with God to another playground and Mother Nature was in a coma. Nothing will never be the same. John knew there might be some people like him, somewhere, fighting the good fights anonymously : soldiers of the fallen empires. There just had to be, but there would be no point in meeting them : « Our fights are unique ! Our fights are personal !».  He remembered reading this in Catalyna, on a wall in the Cold City. That's when he realized he wasn't alone, yet more lonely then ever.
