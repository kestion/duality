			<p>
			In this movie, you’ll see John Phillips like you’ve never seen him.<br /><br />
For those who don’t know him, John Phillips is not what one would expect from a superhero, he’s not a philanthropist, he hasn’t got super powers in the traditional sense, and he doesn’t get involved in physical fights.<br /><br />
He’s a man of habit, who doesn’t stand out in the swelling mass of business men.  Indeed his features are so common that it’s almost impossible to even remember you’ve ever met him.  He plays with this by wearing a contact lense on one of his wall-eyes, in order to look as plain as can be: brown eyes, dark hair, white skin, medium height, medium weight…  Associated with his ability to empathize with anyone and analyze their way of thinking, it enables him to manipulate people’s actions.<br />
His main goal isn’t humanitarian at all; he seeks to polish the world. Fluctuations unleash his mental illness and make him feel nauseous, oppressed. He feels the urge to hammer them down regardless of collateral damage.<br /><br />
Since he was a child he’s never reacted the same way as other children. He’s never been able to make the distinction between him, the world and the others. He considers himself global. He was born and raised in the country side when the world was changing. He was forced to move to the city. At that time, when he was still very young, the society was already split up into two different worlds: the bright and high world of rich people coexisted with the unhealthy and unsound shantytowns. It is the result of a critical crisis economy. Ethic was walked upon and selfish decisions were made till the disappearance of the middle class. Furthermore it created a central mega polis were all the decisions are made.<br /><br />
Seeing all the different contrasts around him, he had a nervous breakdown. He then sat in front of one of the white towers, right in the middle of the street, and took in the essence of the city. By the end of the four days he’d understood the clockwork of the upper-class society and was able to masquerade as one of them. He interjected a man in the street and tricked him into offering him a job as a delivery boy.  His new uniform let him roam around the city unnoticed.<br /><br />
He kept his job ever since because it makes it easy for him to meet the people he needs to convince with the excuse of a personal delivery. When in the person’s office, he persuades him to make unexpected changes in the handling of his company, such as buying a tiny sinking enterprise that would eventually bring the company to an end. He doesn’t consider the consequences of his acts like loss of jobs or death, but the global effect on the society. He acts for the greater good. For example he may turn two heads of two different companies against each other so that they would enter in a war which outcome is the destruction of both corporations. <br /><br />
However in this movie you’ll see a brighter side of John Phillips. His darkest childhood memories will be revealed and we’ll finally know where he got his psychological trauma from.  He will also gain a new companion: Link, a little cat that starts living in John’s appartment. His life will take a turn when he drags the world into recession with him.
